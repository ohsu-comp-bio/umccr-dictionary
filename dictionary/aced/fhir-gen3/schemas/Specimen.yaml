    description: A reference to a location at which the other resource is found. The
      reference may be a relative reference, in which case it is relative to the service
      base URL, or an absolute URL that resolves to the location where the resource
      is found. The reference may be version specific or not. If the reference is
      not to a FHIR RESTful server, then it should be assumed to be version specific.
      Internal fragment references (start with '#') refer to contained resources.
