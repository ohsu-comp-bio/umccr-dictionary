      description: The information determined as a result of making the observation,
        if the information has a simple value. The base quantity that a measured value
        of zero represents. In addition, this provides the units of the entire measurement
        series. How the value should be understood and represented - whether the actual
        value is greater or less than the stated value due to measurement issues;
        e.g. if the comparator is "<" , then the real value is < stated value.  Vocabulary
