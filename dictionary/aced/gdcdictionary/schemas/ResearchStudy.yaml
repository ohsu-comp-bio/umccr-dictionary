      and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative
      need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
      detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
      Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative
      to ensure clinical safety. The actual narrative content, a stripped down version
